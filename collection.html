            <h1>Peacock</h1>
            Indian peafowl <br>
            Pavo critstatus  <br>
            Found - native to India and Sri Lanka, in South Asia <br>
            Features The beautiful feathers that cover the tails of a peacock are 5 feet (1.5 meters) long—longer than the bird's body—and can be displayed in a spectacular fan of brilliant colors. These long feathers actually grow from the bird's back not the tail. He elevates them by raising the much shorter tail feathers underneath them. <br>

            Green peafowl <br>
            Pavo muticus  <br>

            Features - The male is 1.8 - 3 m in total length, but this includes its tail covert (or "train") which itself measures 1.4 - 1.6 m. The tail coverts are even longer than those of the male Indian peafowl, but are shorter than those of the arguses. The adult female is around half the total length of the breeding male at 1 - 1.1 m in length. It has a relatively large wingspan that averages around 1.2 m and can reach 1.6 m in big males. The green peafowl is capable of sustained flight and is often observed on wing. <br>
